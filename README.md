Implementing Random Forest Regressors For Predicting Educational Outcomes and Measuring Feature Importance 

Not all students within a school or classroom respond to the same methods in an academic setting. Students may require an individualized approach to learning so it is hard to pinpoint what specific factors are best to look at. Existing methods of attempting to increase students' success may place an overemphasis on the students' home life or academics, depending on what the student or school official finds valuable. My goal for the project is to implement a machine learning model to identify the factors that lead to lower student success and in what circumstances it would need to be changed. 

The code from this project as well as a report that coincides with it is present.
